## 🌟 About Me

I'm a computer scientist & software engineer driven by a passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Backend Engineering, and Full Stack Development. I'm actively exploring and developing solutions in generative AI, deep learning, classical machine learning, causal inference, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and visual recognition using cutting-edge techniques like GANs, VAEs, Stable Diffusion, CNNs, vision models like ViT, and vision-language models (VLMs).

I’ve engineered systems that tightly integrate prompt engineering, synthetic data generation, and evaluation pipelines, using tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Huggingface, and Ray, to build intelligent, adaptive solutions that go beyond traditional pipelines. I’ve also built custom models from scratch for specific project use cases and conducted model evaluation in research-focused contexts.

As a polymath, I’m deeply curious about a wide spectrum of disciplines, from computer science and AI to robotics, hardware engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, philosophy, and emerging sciences. I thrive on learning, exploring new paradigms, and crafting innovative solutions that merge creativity with technical precision.

Whether I’m building high-performance low-latency software, agentic AI systems, reasoning engines, or simply tinkering with novel ideas, my goal is always the same: to enhance how we live, think, and connect through intelligent technology.
