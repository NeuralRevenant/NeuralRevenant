## 🌟 About Me

I’m a Software Engineer with strong experience in AI/ML, full-stack development, backend engineering, and high-performance computing. My work spans scalable, event-driven architectures and cloud-native platforms, combining robust backend engineering with deep AI capabilities. I specialize in generative AI, NLP, computer vision, transformer models (including vision transformers), LLMs, LLM fine-tuning, agentic AI workflows & AI agents, agentic RAG pipelines, deep learning, ensemble learning, and large-scale inference systems. I enjoy solving complex problems using embeddings, hybrid search, semantic retrieval, and dynamic query planning, building intelligent systems for healthcare, finance, logistics, recommendation platforms, and more.

In addition to strong Python expertise, I have hands-on experience with Java (Spring Boot), C++, and TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, React). I’ve designed and deployed production-grade microservices, authentication engines, and high-throughput pipelines using Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, and AWS/GCP infrastructure, always with a focus on performance, security, and reliability.
