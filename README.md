## 🌟 About Me

I’m a Software Engineer with strong experience in AI/ML, full-stack development, backend engineering, and high-performance computing. My work spans scalable, event-driven architectures and cloud-native platforms, combining robust backend engineering with deep AI capabilities. I specialize in generative AI, NLP, computer vision, transformer models (including vision transformers), LLMs & LLM fine-tuning + pre-training, AI agents, complex agentic AI workflows & frameworks using LLM-driven agents for reasoning, planning, and function orchestration, agentic RAG pipelines, deep learning, ensemble learning, and large-scale inference systems. I’ve developed multi-agent systems with dynamic memory, recursive querying, and tool usage, driving advanced automation across operational pipelines, and I enjoy solving complex problems, building intelligent systems for healthcare, finance, logistics, recommendation platforms, and more.  

In addition to strong Python expertise, I have hands-on experience with Java (Spring Boot), C++, and TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, React). I’ve designed and deployed production-grade microservices, authentication engines, and high-throughput pipelines using Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, and AWS/GCP infrastructure, always with a focus on performance, security, and reliability.
