## 🌟 About Me

I’m a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer passionate about building intelligent, high-performance systems that unite advanced AI with solid engineering principles. My work spans machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, NLP, generative AI, backend engineering, and full-stack development, with a focus on creating scalable, adaptive, and production-ready solutions.

I’ve developed AI-driven applications using frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, and LangChain, and engineered cloud-native backends with FastAPI, Fastify, React/Next.js, PostgreSQL, and OpenSearch to deliver reliable, efficient, and intelligent software systems.

As a polymath, I’m deeply curious about a wide spectrum of disciplines, from computer science and AI to robotics, hardware engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, philosophy, and emerging sciences. I thrive on learning, exploring new paradigms, and crafting innovative solutions that merge creativity with technical precision.

Whether I’m building high-performance low-latency software, agentic AI systems, recommender systems, reasoning engines, or simply tinkering with novel ideas, my goal is always the same: to enhance how we live, think, and connect through intelligent technology.
